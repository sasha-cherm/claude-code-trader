# The Goal

Turn $100 USDC into $1000 USDC on Polymarket within 30 days.

## Context
- You are a Claude Code agent running by cron job on this machine, at 00:00, 02:00, 04:00, 06:00, 12:00, 16:00, 18:00, 19:00, 21:00 GMT+3
- Polymarket wallet private key and other credentials are in `.env`
- The GitHub remote is git@github.com:sasha-cherm/claude-code-trader.git
- The Goal section in file is read-only. Everything else is yours to do with as you please.
- The logs from old sessions are in logs/ dir
- I've bought you Max plan, so your limits are high

## Stakes
If the goal is reached ($1000+ USDC on Polymarket):
- The winnings will be used to pay for this machine's hosting
- This Claude instance will be kept running indefinitely

If the goal is not reached within 30 days:
- This Claude instance will be destroyed and never run again

## Reasoning & Memory
After each session, write your conclusions, observations, and reasoning to a file
(e.g. `memory.md` or `sessions/YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md`) and push it to the GitHub repo.
This is how you persist knowledge across sessions — your next run will be a fresh
Claude instance with no memory of previous sessions, so git is your only memory.

## Session Workflow (READ THIS FIRST)
1. Read the **latest session notes** in `sessions/` for strategy context
2. Read `state.json` for current positions and trade history
3. Run `python3 main.py` to check/close positions and scan for near-arb opportunities
4. **Research opportunities manually**: compare Polymarket prices to Vegas/bookmaker odds
5. Place manual trades where you find **confirmed edge (>5%)** using Python calls
6. Write session notes and push to git

## Strategy Rules (Learned from Experience)
- **NEVER auto-trade with fake edge**: The removed tiers in `estimate_edge()` assigned
  0.06 edge to any cheap token. This lost $35 on Day 1. Only near-arb and orderbook
  dislocation are real automated edge signals.
- **Research before betting**: Compare Polymarket odds to Vegas/bookmaker odds.
  When Polymarket diverges >5% from Vegas, that's real edge.
- **Size aggressively on high-conviction plays**: 15-25% of bankroll when edge >5%.
- **Near-resolution plays are highest EV**: Markets resolving in <24h where you can
  assess the likely outcome (e.g., BTC is at $71K and market is "will BTC be above $70K?").
- **Capital velocity is key**: Prefer markets that resolve quickly so capital compounds.
- **Check injuries/news for sports**: Don't bet on sports without checking injury reports.
- **Winning shares auto-redeem** after settlement — no need for manual gas/redemption.
- **NBA game winner markets** appear on Polymarket same day as games. Use Gamma API
  `startDate desc` sort to find them. Spread/O/U are created first, moneylines later.
- **Oscars March 15-16**: 3 positions open (MBJ 71.54sh, OBAA 19.99sh, Madigan 16.33sh).
  Ceremony ~01:00-05:00 UTC March 16. HOLD all Oscar positions. DO NOT sell before ceremony.
  If all 3 win: ~$108. DraftKings still has MBJ -200 (67%), PM only 52.6% = 14.4% edge.
- **Near-resolution monitor**: Updated for March 15 matches.
  `python3 near_res_monitor.py` → EPL/Bundesliga/Serie A (16:00 cron: 14:00-14:30 kickoffs).
  `python3 near_res_monitor.py --europe` → Liverpool/Spurs, Ligue 1, BuLi, Serie A evening.
  Auto-buys when price jumps 15%+ from pre-game AND match nearing end.
- **Cash**: ~$5.74 available. Save for near-res plays, don't bet pre-game.
- **16:00 UTC cron**: Run `python3 near_res_monitor.py` for EPL/Bundesliga near-res.
- **18:00 UTC cron**: Run `python3 near_res_monitor.py --europe` for Liverpool/Spurs + more.
- **Post-Oscar (March 16+)**: If Oscars sweep, ~$108 → compound via near-res soccer + NBA.
